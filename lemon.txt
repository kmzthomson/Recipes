Lemon cake

Ingredients
For the lemon drizzle

    4 lemons, juice only
    75g/2¾oz caster sugar

For the sponge

    200g/7oz caster sugar
    200g/7oz unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
    2 lemons, zest only
    3 free-range eggs, beaten
    200g/7oz self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting

For the filling

    2 free-range egg yolks
    75g/2¾oz caster sugar
    50g/1¾oz unsalted butter
    2 lemons, juice and zest
    100g/3½oz mascarpone

Method

    1)Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a 20cm/8in springform cake tin with butter, then add a small amount of flour, turn the cake tin to coat the sides and bottom and shake out any excess.
    2)For the lemon drizzle, in a bowl, mix together the lemon juice and sugar until the mixture is well combined and the sugar has melted. Set aside.
    3)For the sponge, beat the sugar, butter and lemon zest in a mixing bowl until pale and fluffy, using an electric whisk. 
    4)Gradually add the eggs, whisking after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated into the mixture before adding the next. Carefully fold in the flour using a metal spoon. 
    5)Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake tin and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and is cooked through. (The sponge is cooked through when a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.)
