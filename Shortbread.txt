Traditional shortbread

Ingredients

    130g/4½oz butter, softened
    60g/2½oz caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
    130g/4½oz plain flour
    60g/2½oz rice flour
    pinch salt 

Method

    	1)Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until pale and fluffy. Add the plain flour, rice flour and salt, and stir well until the mixture is smooth and uniform. (I find it easiest to keep pressing the mixture against the side of the bowl to mix it.)
